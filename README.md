# Discworld
An Unofficial FoundryVTT system for Modiphius' Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork. Shared with Modiphius kind permission.

This system is more cobbled together than the streets of Ankh-Morpork. It is intended for occasional use. As the Modiphius description of the game, the system is intended to be played as a one shot providing respite between sessions of a more serious system. As such the rules are light and easy to follow. in that spirit this VTT system is little more than an online character sheet for you to use to assist your play sessions.

Add this manifest to your FoundryVTT: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokeidlom/discworld/main/src/system.json

It terms of collaboration or support, I'm open to suggestions for improvement, code submissions, PRs and generally anything that makes this better for everyone! If you do want to PR, please do that onto the develop branch.

# Instructions

Once you have your character or NPC sheet you can fill it up with your character's details from the campaign.

The Name, Pronoun, Orgsnisation, Background, and Role fields can be directly typed into.
The Description, Consequences, and Notes fields can also be directly edited, they can also be resized up and down a little as requred to fit your screen and the ammount of text you entered.
The Niche, Core, Quirks, and Traits fields can be added to by clicking on the + next to the title, this will add a new row, which you can edit by clicking on the pen, or delete by clicking on the bin on the same row. These fields are special as they are item fields (see items below).

You will find buttons on the character sheet to make d4, d6, d10, and d12 rolls. These are all the dice the player should need. In case of extra dice being required you can use the dice roller (see the dice roller below).

## Items
By using the item menu, and clicking on "Create Item" you can create one of core, niche, quirk, or trait. These appear on your items menu bar, and can be dragged onto any character sheet. This is a useful way of adding the same of any of these type of traits to a group of characters without needing to type them for each one. In the future if there is a system released with lists of these published then they can also be added to a compendia for convenience.
