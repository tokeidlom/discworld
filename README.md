# Discworld
An Unofficial FoundryVTT system for Modiphius' Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork. Shared with their kind permission.

This system is more cobbled together than the streets of Ankh-Morpork. It is intended for occasional use. As the Modiphius description of their game, the system is intended to be played as a one shot providing respite between sessions of a more serious system. As such the rules are light and easy to follow. in that spirit this VTT system is little more than an online character sheet for you to use to assist your play sessions.

This system is currently in its early development phase, and as such it is less attractive than a pair of Rincewind's old long johns. It is actively being worked on, and should get better over time.

However, just as Ankh-Morpork itself, despite being ugly it somehow manages to defy logic and works anyway. Maybe only because no one told it that it shouldn't!

It terms of collaboration or support, I'm open to suggestions for improvement, code submissions, PRs and generally anything that makes this better for everyone! If you do want to PR, please do that onto the develop branch.
