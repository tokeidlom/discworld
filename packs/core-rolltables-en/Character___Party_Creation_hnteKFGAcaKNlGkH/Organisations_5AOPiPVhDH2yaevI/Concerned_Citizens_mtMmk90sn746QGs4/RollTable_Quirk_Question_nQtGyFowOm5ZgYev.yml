      What are you so worked up about? (This does not have to be the same as the
      rest of the party.)

      <p>The carts go down my street something fierce, we need to slow them
      down; Potholes have ruined more of my wagon’s wheels than you can shake a
      stick at; The state of the city, things were better in the good old
      days!</p>

      <p>We were promised this issue would be sorted and it hasn’t, someone pays
      taxes for this; Everyone else was so riled up, I didn’t want to bring the
      mood down; I couldn’t let others take the city down this path, it’s for
      its own good.</p>

      Who have you tried to approach about your concern, and how have they

      <p>I went straight to the Patrician — well his palace anyway — and I was
      asked to leave; I went to the Watch, they told me it wasn’t within their
      jurisdiction; Some friends in high places, we’re setting up a meeting.</p>
