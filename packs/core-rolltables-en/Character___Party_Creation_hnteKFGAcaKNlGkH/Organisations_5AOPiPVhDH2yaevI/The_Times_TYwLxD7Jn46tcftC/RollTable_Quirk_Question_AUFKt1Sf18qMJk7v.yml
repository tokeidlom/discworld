      <p>I covered the Humorously Shaped Vegetable of the Year Competition; I

      <p>A piece decrying the state of things, no one wants to be reminded how
      bad things are; My report on the Ankh-Morpork Cock and Hen Fanciers’
      annual meeting — there was a bit of a misunderstanding; My interview with
      a vampire, he didn’t really have anything to say.</p>
