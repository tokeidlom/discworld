      <p>Lord Rust, the man has no sense of humour — everyone else thought the
      whitewash was hilarious; Mr Stronginthearm, he’s got a ‘short’ fuse… get
      it?; Anyone with coulrophobia. It’s not my fault they’re terrified of my
      mere existence.</p>

    img: icons/svg/d20-black.svg
    description: >-
      <p>Following in my family’s traditions, we’ve been foolish for
      generations; I thought it’d be a foolproof career choice, I was wrong; I
      was a foundling left on the steps of the Fools’ Guild. I didn’t see the
      rest of the city until I already had my cap and bells.</p>

    img: icons/svg/d20-black.svg
    description: >-
      <p>I used unregistered jokes in my act; I avoided a banana peel, stepped
      around an open manhole, and allowed two dwarfs carrying a sheet of glass
      to pass without even a second glance; I repeatedly forgot to honk sadly
      (and humorously) when forcibly ejected from several drinking
      establishments.</p>

      <p>I suggested that we might be allowed a holiday without whitewash and
      custard pies; I injured several brother Fools, a sausage-inna-bun
      salesman, and multiple passing pigeons when my act went horribly wrong; I
      attempted the bucket-of-whitewash-above-the-door trick on his office.</p>
